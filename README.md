Hi!ðŸ‘‹ This is a project I did for my wedding which was held in Nov 2024.

### Background:
We wanted to do away with the typical seating chart and didn't want to overwhelm our reception with everyone checking for their seats.
So we decided to create this web app that tells guests where they will be seated!

### How it Works
Site: https://phyllistay.github.io/wedding/

1) Select either the Bride or the Groom cake topper - Click on the Groom topper as an example
2) Guests will type their names - You can type in 'Rachel' as an example
3) Seating is assigned!

### How to use it
1) Edit the names of your guests under the app.js file. If you have guests with the same name AND under bride / groom side, you need to add the last name (or anything that differentiates them!)
   Assign the table to the guests accordingly!

3) Change the map.png file to the floorplan of your wedding venue
4) You can of course change anything else from the images (i.e. cake / cake toppers) to the codes if you need to!

I do not use HTML / JS for my work, and do not claim to be proficient in it.
Credits to ChatGPT for the codes. For the images, I had generated them using Meta AI, and then edited them using Procreate.
